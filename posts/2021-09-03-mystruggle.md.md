Before getting started let me introduce myself. As you already know I am Fazley Rabbi currently working as a Backend Developer/Software Engineer (Remotely) at [Electronic First FZ LLE ](https://www.electronicfirst.com/) based in Sharjah,UAE.

Now let's get back to the beginning. I have never imagined that a guy like me would get a job. Genuinely I never thought that. 

After failing my SSC/O Levels I got really depressed and there are other reasons as well I don't want to disclose here maybe some other day. Eventually I passed my SSC and finished my diploma in computer technology. At this moment I have zero experience with programming or any kind of professional development knowledge. While doing my final semester project in diploma I got introduced to an **IT Company** through my friend. This time of my life is very crucial. Someone who is an introvert, very uncomfortable being in a crowd, this moment of my life was a turning point for me.

**2018 January 1st**, I started my first ever Web Development job. Undoubtedly one of the best feeling for me. Although the compensation was below average I didn't give it much of a thought. It was going good. I was learning a lot of technical things. At least that's what I thought. I gave around two years in this company. While working there I have gathered a lot knowledge no doubt. Knowledge about customer relations, Office environment and toxicity as well. Which is very normal if you are working in any corporate job.

Unfortunately if you look into it from a IT professional's perspective those knowledge shall not be a priority for someone who wants to learn about Software Development/Programming at the beginning stage. At the very last moments before I was going to leave that company I faced many problems. Mentally and physically. As someone who has been dealing with anxiety and depressions for the entire life this can't get any worse. I am obviously thankful to them for letting me know how people can be. The only important thing I have learned from here that be humble to them who deserves it. And become an expert on the field you are working. If not then these so called professionals/seniors will exploit you and throw your passion into the waste bin.

At this moment I realized I don't owe anything to this job. I am expandable. I am providing my service and they are simply paying me for it. You may ask! you are not an expert. Why are you bragging so much. My reverse question to you is then why bother keeping me if I have zero value for the company? Besides when I know how much profit you are making through my shitty work why would't I question you? If my work is so immature why would you use them on professional level and make money out of it.

Finally I decided to move on from that job and took a huge break of almost one year. At that time I was doing my bachelor in computer science. Now I started to learn by myself forgetting everything that happened last two years. I started working on my [My Final Year Project](https://fazleyrabbi.me/blog/2021/06/10/routine.html). I successfully finished the project according to my faculty guideline. I have learned a lot by working on this project.It felt really good by working solo on the project from start to end. I have faced many complications and difficult logics yet successfully figured them out on my own. 

After finishing my final project in 2021 January I joined [Amcoders ](https://codecanyon.net/user/amcoders/portfolio) a fully remote startup company. They generally works on codecanyon/envato projects. I joined there as a Laravel Intern and after 3months of internship I was assigned in the permanent role. The point here is I joined as an intern even with two years of experience. The reason behind this decision is I wasn't confident enough to put that experience in my cv and the quality of work wasn't good enough to mention anywhere. In short those two years of my life was wasted. 

After all these struggle in that two years I have met a few people. Even though technically I haven't got any experience I got some connections there. One of the juniors helped me get a job and I will forever be thankful to these people who helped me improve myself I don't care if they are my juniors or senior, older or younger If they helped me even 1% to grow myself I will be in debt to you guys. These people reminded me that even in worst situations there are some people who will have your back. 

After 100 plus applications I finally got my current job. And I am thankful to all my well wishers.

After all these struggles for almost 3years(minus that two years) I can call myself a Junior Developer. And I am thankful that I am able to stick with this path of this vast career. Many more experience and struggles to come. Hope you guys had a great time reading this. The only one thing I would remind you that don't give up even though you feel like your career is not going anywhere. Find the lackings and improve them every single day. Best of luck, peace out! ðŸ¤ž
